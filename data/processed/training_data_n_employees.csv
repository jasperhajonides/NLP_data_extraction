The change from 2017 to 2018 is due to a lower MCIP and GSIP performance ratio comparing to the previous year. (b) Calculated using the data for Dutch purposes from the Executive Directors single figure table on page 66 (for information on exchange rates please see the footnotes in that table). As at October 2015 Jean-Marc Huet stepped down as CFO and therefore the figures only include ten months for 2015. Graeme Pitkethly succeeded Jean-Marc Huet as an Executive Director as per 21 April 2016, although he assumed the role of CFO as from October 2015. As a result the figure for 2016 include payments from May 2016 onwards. The CFO remuneration from 2015 to 2016 therefore decreased, which was also due to Graeme Pitkethly's Fixed Pay being set at a level lower than Jean-Marc Huet's. (c) Calculated using the total staff costs (minus the CEO and CFO remuneration pursuant to Dutch requirements as included in the Executive Directors single figure tables) divided by the average number of employees during the year, using the data from Staff and Management costs from note 4A on page 97. (d) Calculated using the data for Dutch purposes from the Executive Directors single figure table on page 66 divided by the average total compensation per FTE number in this table for the respective year. (e) USG and UOM are relevant performance measures for both our bonus and long-term incentive plans and Underlying EPS is a relevant performance measure since 2017 when we introduced it for MCIP. In 2019 the definition of USG has changed and currently includes a normalised level of price growth, which will be capped at an annual rate that is equivalent to approximately 2% per month compounded. As result of this new definition USG figures for 2016, 2017 and 2018 have been restated compared to previous disclosures. (f) The CEO and CFO % change from 2016 to 2017 is due to a higher MCIP and GSIP performance ratio compared to the previous years. The year-on-year changes in pay for the average compensation for an employee (FTE) are proportionally smaller than for the CEO and CFO.
