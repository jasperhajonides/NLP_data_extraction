Other factors not presently known to us or, that we presently believe are not material, could also affect our business operations and financial results. \",\n",
       "   'Strategic Risks ',\n",
       "   'Changes in Consumer Demand   We are exposed to changes in consumer demand patterns and customer requirements in numerous industries. ',\n",
       "   ' Sales of our products and services depend heavily on the volume of sales made by our customers to consumers. Consequently, changes in consumer preferences for products in the industries that we serve or the packaging formats in which such products are delivered, whether as a result of changes in cost, convenience or health, environmental and social concerns and perceptions, may result in a decline in the demand for certain of our products or the obsolescence of some of our existing products. Although we have adopted certain strategies designed to mitigate the impact of declining sales, there is no guarantee that such strategies will be successful or will offset a decline in demand. Furthermore, any new products that we produce may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors, including our inability to accurately predict customer demand, end user preferences or movements in industry standards or to develop products that meet consumer demand in a timely and cost- effective manner. ',\n",
       "   ' Changing preferences for products and packaging formats may result in increased demand for other products we produce. However, to the extent changing preferences are not offset by demand for new or alternative products, changes to consumer preferences could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. ',\n",
       "   'Key Customers and Customer Consolidation   The loss of key customers, a reduction in their production requirements or consolidation among key customers could have a significant adverse impact on our sales revenue and profitability. ',\n",
       "   ' Relationships with our customers are fundamental to our success, particularly given the nature of the packaging industry and the other supply choices available to customers. From time to time, a single customer, depending on the current status and volumes of a number of separate contracts in disparate locations, may account for 10% or more of our revenue. Sales to our largest customer accounted for approximately 11% of our total net sales for fiscal years 2019 and 2018. We did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10% of our net sales in 2020 or sales to any other customer that accounted for more than 10% of net sales in these fiscal periods. ',\n",
       "   ' Customer concentration can be even more pronounced within certain business units. Consequently, the loss of any of our key customers or any significant reduction in their production requirements, or an adverse change in the terms of our supply agreements with them, could reduce our sales revenue and net profit. ',\n",
       "   ' There can be no guarantee that our key customers will not in the future seek to source some or all of their products or services from competitors, change to alternative forms of packaging, begin manufacturing their packaging products in-house or seek to renew their business with us on terms less favorable than before.

       "   ' Any loss, change or other adverse event related to our key customer relationships could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations, which effect may be material. ',\n",
       "   ' In addition, over recent years certain of our customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines. This consolidation has increased the concentration of our business with these customers. Such consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices, reflecting the increase in the total volume of products purchased or the elimination of a price differential between the acquiring customer and the company acquired. While we have generally been successful at managing customer consolidations, increased pricing pressures from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. ',\n",

Our ability to grow organically may be limited by, among other things, extensive saturation in the locations in which we operate or a change or reduction in our customers  growth plans due to changing economic conditions, strategic priorities or otherwise. For many of our businesses, organic growth depends on product innovation, new product development and timely responses to changing consumer demands and preferences. Consequently, failure to develop new or improved products in response to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner may hinder our growth potential, affect our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations. ',\n",

There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets in the right geographic regions and with the right participation strategy in the future, or to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms or at all. Other companies in the industries and regions in which we operate have similar investment and acquisition strategies to us, resulting in competition for a limited pool of potential acquisition targets. Due in part to that competition, as well as the recent low interest rate environment, which has made debt funding more appealing and accessible, price multiples for potential targets are currently higher than their historical averages. If, as a result of these and other factors, we are unable to identify acquisition targets that meet our investment criteria and close such transactions on acceptable terms, our potential for growth by way of acquisition may be restricted, which could have an adverse effect on achievement of our strategy and the resulting expected financial benefits.

For example, we expect the Bemis acquisition in 2019 will generate estimated pre-tax annual net cost synergies by the end of the third year of approximately $180 million from procurement, manufacturing and general and administrative efficiencies. While we are currently on track to achieve the targeted Bemis synergies, we cannot predict with certainty that the full savings will be realized or current savings will be sustained. If we are not able to successfully integrate our acquisitions and achieve the expected synergy cost savings, the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected or involve more costs to do so.

Measures providing for business shutdowns generally exclude essential services and the critical infrastructure supporting the essential services. We have experienced minimal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing essential services. However, we have experienced volatility in customer order patterns in the second half of our fiscal year 2020 and could continue to experience significant volatility in the demand for our products in the future.

In limited cases to date, certain customers have shut down their operations temporarily to deal with the outbreak within their facilities, which has impacted their demand, and we may continue to experience the volatility in demand from temporary customer shutdowns. In addition, the coronavirus has significantly impacted and may further impact the economies and financial markets of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.

The current global economic challenges, including relatively high levels of unemployment in certain areas in which we operate, low economic growth and difficulties associated with managing rising debt levels and related economic volatility in certain economies, are likely to continue to put pressure on the global economy and our business.

In addition, many of the geographic areas where our production is located and where we conduct business may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes, snowstorms, hurricanes, forest fires and flooding.

Such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented employee safety measures across all our supply chain facilities, including proper hygiene, social distancing and temporary screening which at a minimum are in compliance with local government regulations. These measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our employees. Illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism, or other workforce disruptions could negatively impact our supply chain, manufacturing, distribution or other business activities. ',\n",

If a counterparty defaults on a payment obligation to us, we may be unable to collect the amounts owed and some or all of these outstanding amounts may need to be written off. If a counterparty becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations in connection with a particular project, we may need to find a replacement to fulfill that party s obligations or, alternatively, fulfill those obligations ourself, which is likely to be more expensive.

For instance, an increase in legislation with respect to litter related to plastic packaging or related recycling programs may cause legislators in some countries and regions in which our products are sold to consider banning or limiting certain packaging formats or materials. Additionally, increased regulation of emissions linked to climate change, including greenhouse gas (carbon) emissions and other climate-related regulations, could potentially increase the cost of our operations due to increased costs of compliance (which may not be recoverable through adjustment of prices), increased cost of fossil fuel inputs and increased cost of energy intensive raw material inputs. However, any such changes are uncertain, and we cannot predict the amount of additional capital expenses or operating expenses that would be necessary for compliance. ',\n",

In July 2017, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"), a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities.

We are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, however, we are not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2021, whether SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of such a possible transition to SOFR may be on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Transactional foreign exchange exposures result from exchange rate fluctuations, including in respect of the U.S. dollar, the Euro, and other currencies, including in Latin America, in which our costs are denominated, which may affect our business input costs and proceeds from product sales. Translational foreign exchange exposures result from exchange rate fluctuations in the conversion of entity functional currencies to U.S. dollars, consistent with our reporting currency, and may affect the reported value of our assets and liabilities and our income and expenses. In particular, our translational exposure may be impacted by movements in the exchange rate between the Euro and the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar.

These methods include the use of a discount rate to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows of our reporting units. Future changes in the cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors may cause our goodwill and/or other intangible assets to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write down these assets for the amount of the impairment. In addition, if we make changes in our business strategy or if external conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, adversely affect our business operations we may be required to record an impairment charge for goodwill or intangibles, which would lead to decreased assets and reduced net operating results.

       "   'Amcor is a global leader in developing and producing responsible packaging for food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical, home and personal-care, and other products. Amcor works with leading companies around the world to protect their products and the people who rely on them, differentiate brands, and improve supply chains through a range of flexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons, closures, and services. The company is focused on making packaging that is increasingly light- weighted, recyclable and reusable, and made using an increasing amount of recycled content. During fiscal year 2020, approximately 47,000 Amcor employees generated $12.5 billion in sales from operations that spanned approximately 231 locations in over 40 countries. ',\n",
       "   'Significant Items Affecting the Periods Presented ',\n",
       "   'Impact of COVID-19 ',\n",
       "   ' The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") has introduced a period of unprecedented uncertainty and challenge. Amcor s operations have been largely recognized as \\'essential\\' by governments and authorities around the world given the role we play in the supply chains for critical food and healthcare products. Our scale and global footprint has enabled us to collaborate with customers and suppliers to meet volatile changes in demand and continue to service our customers. In dealing with the exceptional challenges posed by COVID-19, we have established three guiding principles focusing on the health and safety of our employees, keeping our operations running and contributing to relief efforts in our communities. ',\n",
       "   'Health and Safety ',\n",
       "   ' Our commitment to the health and safety of its employees remains our first priority. Our rigorous precautionary measures include the formation of global and regional response teams that maintain contact with authorities and experts to actively manage the situation, restrictions on company travel, quarantine protocols for employees who may have had exposure or have symptoms, frequent disinfecting of Amcor locations and other measures designed to help protect employees, customers and suppliers. We expect to continue these measures until the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for our business. ',\n",
       "   'Operations and Supply Chain ',\n",
       "   ' To support our business partners, we have instituted business continuity plans in each of our operations and offices globally which address infection prevention measures, incident response, return to work protocols and supply chain risks. We have experienced minimal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing essential services. However, we have experienced volatility in customer order patterns in the second half of fiscal year 2020 and could continue to experience significant volatility in the demand for our products in the future. For instance, in April, our Rigid Packaging Segment sales volumes in North America and Latin America were adversely impacted as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and on-the-go channels. Our facilities have largely been exempt from government mandated closure orders and while governmental measures may be modified, we expect that our operations will remain operational given the essential products we supply. However, despite our best efforts to contain the impact in our facilities, it remains possible that significant disruptions could occur as a result of the pandemic, including temporary closures of our facilities. ',\n",
       "   ' We have not experienced any significant disruptions in our supply chain to date and continue to monitor the risk of customer, raw material and other supply chain disruptions. ',\n",
       "   'Contributions to Our Communities ',\n",
       "   ' To support our local communities, we launched a global program to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 by donating food and healthcare packaging products and by funding local community initiatives to improve access to healthcare, education or food and other essential products. ',\n",
       "   'Looking Ahead ',\n",
       "   ' We believe we are well-positioned to meet the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of this pandemic or its ultimate impact on the global economy and our operations and financial results. The ultimate near-term impact of the pandemic on our business will depend on the extent and nature of any future disruptions across the supply chain, the duration of social distancing measures and other government imposed restrictions and the nature and pace of macroeconomic recovery in key global economies.

As previously announced, we continue to target realizing approximately $180 million of pre-tax synergies driven by procurement, supply chain, and general and administrative savings by the end of fiscal year 2022. ',\n",
       "   ' Our total 2019 Bemis Integration Plan pre-tax integration costs are expected to be approximately $200 million. The total 2019 Bemis Integration Plan costs include $165 million of restructuring and related expenses and $35 million of general integration expenses. The restructuring and related expenses are comprised of approximately $90 million in employee related expenses, $25 million in fixed asset related expenses, $20 million in other restructuring and $30 million in restructuring related expenses. We estimate that approximately $150 million of the $200 million total integration costs will result in cash expenditures, of which $115 million relate to restructuring and related expenditures. Cash payments for the fiscal year 2020 were $80.2 million, of which $54.1 million were payments related to restructuring and related expenditures. The 2019 Bemis Integration Plan relates to the Flexibles segment and Corporate and is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2022. ',\n",
       "   ' Restructuring related costs are directly attributable to restructuring activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. General integration costs are not linked to restructuring. We believe the disclosure of restructuring related costs provides more information on the total cost of our 2019 Bemis Integration Plan. The restructuring related costs relate primarily to the closure of facilities and include costs to replace graphics, train new employees on relocated equipment and anticipated loss on sale of closed facilities.

       "   'On August 21, 2018, we announced a restructuring plan in Amcor Rigid Packaging (\"2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan\") aimed at reducing structural costs and optimizing the footprint.

',\n",
       "   ' Our total 2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan pre-tax restructuring costs are expected to be approximately $110 million with the main component being the cost to exit manufacturing facilities and employee related costs. The total plan cost has been increased by approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 due primarily to additional non-cash impairments. We estimate that approximately $70 million of the $110 million total costs will result in cash expenditures. Cash payments for the fiscal year 2020 were $23.6 million. The 2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan is expected to be completed during fiscal year 2021. ',\n",
       "   ' On June 9, 2016, we announced a major initiative (\"2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan\") to optimize the cost base and drive earnings growth in the Flexibles segment. This initiative was designed to accelerate the pace of adapting the organization within developed markets through footprint optimization to better align capacity with demand, increase utilization and improve the cost base and streamlining the organization and reducing complexity, particularly in Europe, to enable greater customer focus and speed to market. ',\n",
       "   ' As part of the 2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan, we had closed eight manufacturing facilities and reduced headcount at certain facilities. Our total pre-tax restructuring costs were $230.8 million, with $166.7 million in employee termination costs, $31.4 million in fixed asset impairment costs and $32.7 million in other costs, which primarily represent the cost to dismantle equipment and terminate existing lease contracts. Approximately $166 million of the $230.8 million in total program costs resulted in cash expenditures. Cash payments for fiscal year 2019 were $14.4 million.

The recognized tax benefits are measured as the largest benefit of having a more likely than not likelihood of being sustained upon settlement. Significant estimates are required in determining such uncertain tax positions and related income tax expense and benefit.

Significant judgments and estimates, including expected future performance of operations and taxable earnings and the feasibility of tax planning strategies, are required in determining the need for and amount of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets.

       "   'As described in Notes 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s consolidated goodwill balance was $5,339.3 million at June 30, 2020, and the goodwill associated with the Flexibles Segment was $4,369.1 million, which includes goodwill associated with the Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America reporting units. Management conducts an impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred during the year. Management performed a quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment, utilizing present value (discounted cash flow) methods to determine the fair value of the reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, management would recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit, adjusted for any tax benefits, limited to the amount of the carrying value of goodwill. Management s projected future cash flows for the Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America reporting units included significant judgments and assumptions relating to revenue growth, projected operating income growth, terminal values, and discount rates. ',\n",
       "   'The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America reporting units within the Flexibles Segment is a critical audit matter are that there was significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurement of the reporting units. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management s projected future cash flows and significant assumptions, including revenue growth, projected operating income growth, terminal values, and discount rates. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained. ',\n",

Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company has the ability to record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill.

Management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis and adjusts or revises the estimates as circumstances change.

Monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the entity s functional currency are remeasured at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date to the entity s functional currency. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to short-term and long-term debt are recorded in other non-operating income (loss), net, in the consolidated statement of income.

In making these assessments, management must often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions.

The Company will vigorously defend its positions and believes it will prevail on most, if not all, of these matters. The Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially impact the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under customary local regulations, the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries may need to post cash or other collateral if a challenge to any administrative assessment proceeds to the Brazilian court system; however, the level of cash or collateral already pledged or potentially required to be pledged would not significantly impact the liquidity of Amcor. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company has recorded an accrual of $11.9 million and $16.4 million, respectively, included in other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and has estimated a reasonably possible loss exposure in excess of the accrual of $18.4 million and $23.7 million, respectively. The litigation process is subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters cannot be accurately predicted. The Company routinely assesses these matters as to probability of ultimately incurring a liability and records the best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where the likelihood of an ultimate loss is probable. The Company's assessments are based on its knowledge and experience, but the ultimate outcome of any of these matters may differ from the Company's estimates. \",\n",

       "   ' Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2020. The term \"disclosure controls and procedures,\" as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC\\'s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed, and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgement in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company\\'s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2020 due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting that was identified in our prospectus filed with the SEC on March 25, 2019 and is still being remediated, as described below. ',\n",
       "   \"Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \",\n",
       "   ' Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our management evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the \"COSO framework\" (2013)). ',\n",
       "   ' Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: ',\n",
       "   \"  pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;   provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management and directors of the Company's authorization; and   provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \",\n",
       "   ' A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Accordingly, even effective internal controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. ',\n",
       "   'As previously described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we identified a material weakness arising from deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the period end reporting process. Specifically, we did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that conflicting duties were appropriately segregated within key IT systems used in the preparation and reporting of financial information. This control deficiency did not result in a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements. However, the control deficiency could have resulted in misstatements of our interim or annual consolidated financial statements and disclosures that may have not been prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020 given a previously identified material weakness had not been remediated as of fiscal 2020 year end. ',\n",
       "   'The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers AG, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears on \"Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ',\n",
       "   'Plan for Remediation of Material Weakness ',\n",
       "   'We are currently in the process of remediating the material weakness related to deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over period end reporting through a process to (i) develop and implement additional controls and procedures to reduce the number of segregation of duties conflicts within key IT systems, which includes the implementation of new security roles and the automation of segregation of duties monitoring where practical, (ii) design and implement additional compensating controls where necessary and (iii) develop training on segregation of duties. Given we operate many ERP systems globally, this effort has targeted the largest locations with standardized systems in fiscal 2020 and will be expanded to other locations in fiscal 2021. These enhanced processes, including the implementation of new mitigating controls, will effectively remediate the material weakness, but the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the revised controls operate for a sufficient period of time and we have concluded, through testing, they are designed and operating effectively. We currently expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed by the end of fiscal 2021. However, there is no assurance that the material weakness will be fully remediated by the end of fiscal 2021 as the severity and length of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic is unknown and the remediation timeline could be negatively impacted because of inefficiencies caused by COVID-19 limitations on travel, meetings and on-site work. ',\n",

       "   'As previously described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we identified a material weakness related to a lack of experience in technical accounting in U.S. GAAP and U.S. domestic registrant filing requirements. Since the material weakness has been identified, we have taken numerous steps to address the underlying causes and to remediate the material weakness. We have hired additional financial reporting personnel with U.S. GAAP technical accounting and financial reporting experience, as well as U.S. domestic registrant filing experience, aligned our accounting policies and procedures with U.S. GAAP, enhanced our internal review procedures during the financial close process with U.S. GAAP experienced staff, and have conducted technical training for accounting and finance personnel. During our fourth fiscal quarter of 2020, we completed our testing of the operating effectiveness of the implemented steps and found them to be effective. As a result, we have concluded the material weakness has been remediated as of June 30, 2020. ',\n",

We have experienced minimal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing essential services.

Our scale and global footprint has enabled us to collaborate with customers and suppliers to meet volatile changes in demand and continue to service our customers.

Depending on the nature of derivatives designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in shareholders  equity through other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized.

For the company-sponsored plans, the relevant accounting guidance requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used to determine the present value of future obligations and expenses, salary inflation rates, mortality rates and other assumptions. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to its pension plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets, actuarial valuations, market conditions and contracted benefit changes. The selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation, as well as independent studies of trends performed by the Company s actuaries. However, actual results may differ substantially from the estimates that were based on the critical assumptions. ',\n",

Accumulated actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent corridor and the prior service cost are amortized on a straight-line basis from the date recognized over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average life expectancy for plans with significant inactive participants. The service costs related to defined benefits are included in operating income.

       "  'Equity Method Investments: Investments in ordinary shares of companies, in which the Company believes it exercises significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the investment is carried at cost and is adjusted to recognize the investor s share of earnings or losses of the investee after the date of acquisition and is adjusted for impairment whenever it is determined that a decline in the fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary. The fair value of the investment then becomes the new cost basis of the investment and it is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value. Impairment losses have been recognized for the Company\\'s equity investment in AMVIG Holdings Limited (\"AMVIG\") in the last three fiscal years.

For awards with a performance condition, the Company must reassess the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjust compensation cost based on its probability assessment. The Company also has cash-settled share-based compensation plans which are accounted for as liabilities. Such share-based awards are remeasured to fair value at each reporting period. The Company estimates forfeitures based on employee level, economic conditions, time remaining to vest and historical forfeiture experience. ',\n",
       "  'Income Taxes: The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based upon enacted income tax laws and tax rates. Income tax expense or benefit is provided based on earnings reported in the consolidated financial statements. The provision for income tax expense or benefit differs from the amounts of income taxes currently payable because certain items of income and expense included in the consolidated financial statements are recognized in different time periods by taxing authorities. ',\n",
       "  ' Deferred tax assets, including operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards, are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that any portion of these tax attributes will not be realized. In addition, from time to time, management must assess the need to accrue or disclose uncertain tax positions for proposed adjustments from various tax authorities who regularly audit the Company in the normal course of business. In making these assessments, management must often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions. Accounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records the related interest expense and penalties, if any, as tax expense in the tax provision. See Note 16, \"Income Taxes,\" for more information on the Company\\'s income taxes.

Given we operate many ERP systems globally, this effort has targeted the largest locations with standardized systems in fiscal 2020 and will be expanded to other locations in fiscal 2021. These enhanced processes, including the implementation of new mitigating controls, will effectively remediate the material weakness, but the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the revised controls operate for a sufficient period of time and we have concluded, through testing, they are designed and operating effectively. We currently expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed by the end of fiscal 2021. However, there is no assurance that the material weakness will be fully remediated by the end of fiscal 2021 as the severity and length of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic is unknown and the remediation timeline could be negatively impacted because of inefficiencies caused by COVID-19 limitations on travel, meetings and on-site work.

Since the material weakness has been identified, we have taken numerous steps to address the underlying causes and to remediate the material weakness. We have hired additional financial reporting personnel with U.S. GAAP technical accounting and financial reporting experience, as well as U.S. domestic registrant filing experience, aligned our accounting policies and procedures with U.S. GAAP, enhanced our internal review procedures during the financial close process with U.S. GAAP experienced staff, and have conducted technical training for accounting and finance personnel.

       "   Amcor plc (ARBN 630 385 278) is a holding company originally incorporated under the name Arctic Jersey Limited as a limited company under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey in July 2018, in order to effect the Company's combination with Bemis Company, Inc. On October 10, 2018, Arctic Jersey Limited was renamed \"Amcor plc\" and became a public limited company incorporated under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey. ,\n",
       "  Bemis Company, Inc. Merger ,\n",
       "   On June 11, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc. (\"Bemis\"), a global manufacturer of flexible packaging products, pursuant to the definitive merger agreement (the \"Agreement\") between Amcor Limited and Bemis dated August 6, 2018. Under the terms of the Agreement, Bemis shareholders received 5.1 Amcor shares for each share of Bemis stock and Amcor shareholders received one Amcor CHESS Depositary Instrument (\"CDI\") for each share of Amcor Limited stock issued and outstanding. Upon completion of the transaction, the Amcor shares were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") under the symbol \"AMCR\" and the CDI's representing our shares on the Australian Securities Exchange (\"ASX\") are traded under the symbol \"AMC.\" In addition, Amcor Limited shares were delisted from the ASX and Bemis shares were delisted from the NYSE. ,\n",
       "  Business Strategy ,\n",
       "  Strategy ,\n",
       "  Our strategy consists of three components: a focused portfolio, differentiated capabilities, and our aspiration to be THE leading global packaging company. To fulfill our aspiration, we are determined to win for our customers, employees, shareholders and the environment. ,\n",
       "  Focused portfolio ,\n",
       "   Our portfolio of businesses share some important characteristics: ,\n",
       "    A focus on primary packaging for fast-moving consumer goods,   good industry structure,   attractive relative growth, and   multiple paths for us to win from our leadership position, scale and other competitive advantages. ,\n",
       "   These criteria have led us to the focused portfolio of strong businesses we have today across: flexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons, and closures. ,\n",
       "  Differentiated capabilities ,\n",
       "   \"The Amcor Way\" describes the capabilities deployed consistently across Amcor that enable us to get leverage across our portfolio: Talent, Commercial Excellence, Operational Leadership, Innovation, and Cash and Capital Discipline. ,\n",
       "  Shareholder value creation ,\n",
       "   Through our portfolio of focused business and differentiated capabilities we generate strong cash flow and redeploy cash to consistently create superior customer value. The defensive nature of our end markets mean that year-to-year volatility should be relatively low, measured on a constant currency basis. Over time value creation has been strong and consistent through paying dividends and growing the base business organically in a defensive set of end markets and pursuing targeted acquisitions or by returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks. ,\n",

       "   Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 280, \"Segment Reporting,\" establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements. In applying the criteria set forth in ASC 280, the Company has determined it has two reporting segments, Flexibles and Rigid Packaging. The reporting segments produce flexible packaging, rigid packaging, specialty cartons, and closure products, which are sold to customers participating in a range of attractive end use areas throughout Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa and the Asia Pacific regions. Refer to Note 20, \"Segments,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information about reporting segments. ,\n",
       "  Flexibles Segment ,\n",
       "   The Flexibles Segment develops and supplies flexible packaging globally. With approximately 40,000 employees at 181 principal manufacturing facilities in 39 countries as of June 30, 2020, the Flexibles Segment is one of the world's largest suppliers of plastic, aluminum and fiber based flexible packaging. In fiscal year 2020, Flexibles accounted for approximately 78% of the Company s consolidated net sales. ,\n",
       "  Rigid Packaging Segment ,\n",
       "   The Rigid Packaging Segment manufacturers rigid packaging containers and related products in the Americas. As of June 30, 2020, the Rigid Packaging Segment employed approximately 6,000 employees at 50 principal manufacturing facilities in 11 countries. In fiscal year 2020, Rigid Packaging accounted for approximately 22% of the Company s consolidated net sales. ,\n",
       "  Marketing, Distribution, and Competition ,\n",
       "   Our sales are made through a variety of distribution channels, but primarily through our direct sales force. Sales offices and plants are located throughout Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa and Asia-Pacific regions to provide prompt and economical service to thousands of customers. Our technically trained sales force is supported by product development engineers, design technicians, field service technicians, and a customer service organization. ,\n",
       "   We did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2020. Sales to PepsiCo, and its subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 11.1% and 11.0% of our sales in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Business arrangements with PepsiCo are aggregated across a number of separate contracts in disparate locations and any change in these business arrangements would typically occur over a period of time. ,\n",
       "   The major markets in which we sell our products historically have been, and continue to be, highly competitive. Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality, and price. Competitors include AptarGroup, Inc., Ball Corporation, Berry Global Group, Inc, CCL Industries Inc., Crown Holdings, Inc., Graphic Packaging Holding Company, Huhtamaki Oyj, International Paper Company, Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG, O-I Glass, Inc., Sealed Air Corporation, Silgan Holdings Inc., Sonoco Products Company and WestRock Company, and a variety of privately held companies. ,\n",

       "   Working capital fluctuates throughout the year in relation to business volume and other marketplace conditions. We maintain inventory levels that provide a reasonable balance between obtaining raw materials at favorable prices and maintaining adequate inventory levels to enable us to fulfill our commitment to promptly fill customer orders. Manufacturing backlogs are not a significant factor in the industries in which we operate. ,\n",
       "  Raw Materials ,\n",
       "   Polymer resins and films, paper, inks, adhesives, aluminum, and chemicals constitute the major raw materials we use. These are purchased from a variety of global industry sources, and we are not significantly dependent on any one supplier for our raw materials. While temporary industry-wide shortages of raw materials may occur, we expect to continue to successfully manage raw material supplies without significant supply interruptions. Currently, raw materials are readily available but pricing may fluctuate. ,\n",

       "   We are the owner or licensee of a number of United States and other country patents and patent applications that relate to our products, manufacturing processes, and equipment. We have a number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and in other countries. We also keep certain technology and processes as trade secrets. Our patents, licenses, and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage. However, the loss of any single patent or license alone would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as a whole or those of our reporting segments. Patents, patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise. ,\n",
       "  Sustainability, Innovation and Environmental Laws and Regulations ,\n",
       "   We believe there will always be a role for the primary packages made by Amcor. Packaging protects and preserves food and healthcare products, and reduces the carbon footprint and waste of products. It extends shelf life and reduces food and other product loss across a range of distribution channels. Consumers want cost effective, convenient and easy to use packaging which also has an end of life solution to reduce waste. We believe responsible packaging is the answer to achieve less waste through innovative packaging design, waste management infrastructure and consumer participation. ,\n",
       "   Amcor is committed to responsible packaging and we see this as being integral to our success. In January 2018, we became the first global packaging company pledging to develop all of our packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025, to significantly increase our use of recycled materials and to work with others to drive greater recycling of packaging around the world. ,\n",
       "   We are highly regarded for our innovation capabilities and we have thousands of active patents. We collaborate with customers, suppliers, and innovators to create industry-leading solutions, and with stakeholders to increase available infrastructure for waste collection, sorting and recycling and to inform consumers about the environmental implications of their packaging. We are uniquely positioned to lead the way in the development of more sustainable or environmentally friendly packaging. Addressing the need for and increasing the supply of responsible packaging is one of the most important growth opportunities for Amcor. ,\n",
       "   Our operations and the real property we own or lease are subject to broad environmental laws and regulations by multiple jurisdictions. These laws and regulations pertain to the discharge of certain materials into the environment, handling and disposition of waste, and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water as well as various other protections of the environment. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations based on implementation of our Environmental, Health, and Safety Management System and regular audits of those processes and systems. However, we cannot predict with certainty that we will not in the future, incur liability, with respect to noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations due to contamination of sites formerly or currently owned or operated by us (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites) or the off-site disposal of regulated materials, which could be material. In addition, these laws and regulations are constantly changing, and we cannot always anticipate these changes. Refer to Note 19, \"Contingencies and Legal Proceedings,\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information about legal proceedings. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business, see Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\". ,\n",
       "  Employees ,\n",
       "   As of June 30, 2020, we employed approximately 47,000 people worldwide, with approximately 42% of those employees being covered by collective bargaining agreements. Our relations with employees under collective bargaining agreements remain satisfactory and there have been no significant work stoppages or other labor disputes during the past three years. For more on collective bargaining and labor disputes, see \"Item 1A - Risk Factors.\" ,\n",

       " 28: [the countries in which we operate, particularly the emerging markets, do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as the laws of the more developed jurisdictions in which we operate, such as the United States and the European Union. The use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce certain of our competitive advantages, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. The costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could also adversely impact our business. Similarly, while we have not received any significant claims from third parties suggesting that we may be infringing on their intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that we will not receive such claims in the future. If we were held liable for a claim of infringement, we could be required to pay damages, obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products. Intellectual property litigation, which could result in substantial cost to us and divert the attention of management, may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others  proprietary rights. We may not prevail in any such litigation, and if we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all. Failure to protect our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. ,\n",

       "  Global Health Outbreaks   Our business and operations may be adversely affected by the recent 2019 Novel Coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") outbreak or other similar outbreaks. ,\n",
       "  Our business and financial results may be negatively impacted by outbreaks of contagious diseases, including the recent outbreak of the coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, governmental authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement numerous and constantly evolving measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on gatherings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns. Measures providing for business shutdowns generally exclude essential services and the critical infrastructure supporting the essential services. We have experienced minimal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing essential services. However, we have experienced volatility in customer order patterns in the second half of our fiscal year 2020 and could continue to experience significant volatility in the demand for our products in the future. We have also impaired an equity method investment by $25.6 million in the fourth quarter, in part, partially due to general market declines associated with the pandemic. See Note 7, \"Equity Method Investments\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impairment. ,\n",
       "  The outbreak has in the past, and could in the future result in the temporary closure of our facilities, the facilities of our suppliers, or other vendors in our supply chain. In limited cases to date, certain customers have shut down their operations temporarily to deal with the outbreak within their facilities, which has impacted their demand, and we may continue to experience the volatility in demand from temporary customer shutdowns. In addition, the coronavirus has significantly impacted and may further impact the economies and financial markets of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The coronavirus may result in a prolonged economic downturn, such as increased unemployment, decreases in capital spending, business shutdowns, or economic recessions, which could negatively affect demand for our customers  products. Despite our efforts to manage these impacts, the extent to which the coronavirus or other outbreaks impact our business and operations, including our ability to secure financing at attractive rates, is unknown and the effect could be material. ,\n",
       "  Global Operations   Challenging current and future global economic conditions have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business operations and financial results. ,\n",
       "   Demand for our products and services is dependent on consumer demand for our packaging products, including packaged food, beverage, healthcare, personal care, agribusiness, industrial, and other consumer goods. As a result, general economic downturns in our key geographic regions and globally can adversely affect our business operations and financial results. The current global economic challenges, including relatively high levels of unemployment in certain areas in which we operate, low economic growth and difficulties associated with managing rising debt levels and related economic volatility in certain economies, are likely to continue to put pressure on the global economy and our business. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased volatility in world economies. ,\n",
       "   When challenging economic conditions exist, our customers may delay, decrease or cancel purchases from us, and may also delay payment or fail to pay us altogether. Suppliers may have difficulty filling our orders and distributors may have difficulty getting our products to customers, which may affect our ability to meet customer demands, and result in a loss of business. Weakened global economic conditions may also result in unfavorable changes in our product prices and product mix and lower profit margins. All of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations, which effect may be material. ,\n",

For example, the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union has resulted in uncertainty regarding the long-term nature of the United Kingdom s relationship with the European Union, causing significant volatility in global financial markets and altering the conduct of market participants. Political developments such as this could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, and may cause us to lose customers, suppliers and employees, and adversely impact profitability. ,\n",

Failure to do so could result in breach by our employees of various laws and regulations, including those relating to money laundering, corruption, export control, fraud, bribery, insider trading, antitrust, competition and economic sanctions, whether due to a lack of integrity or awareness or otherwise.

All of the raw materials we use are purchased from third parties and our primary inputs include polymer resins and films, inks and solvents, aluminum and fiber-based carton board. Prices for these raw materials are subject to substantial fluctuations that are beyond our control due to factors such as changing economic conditions, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), currency and commodity price fluctuations, resource availability, transportation costs, weather conditions and natural disasters, political unrest and instability, and other factors impacting supply and demand pressures.

In addition, many of the geographic areas where our production is located and where we conduct business may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes, snowstorms, hurricanes, forest fires and flooding. Any unplanned plant downtime at any of our facilities would likely result in unabsorbed fixed costs that could negatively impact our results of operations for the period in which it experienced the downtime. ,\n",
       "   Supply shortages or disruptions in our supply chain, including as a result of sourcing materials from a single supplier or those that may occur related to the COVID-19 pandemic or other natural disasters, could affect our ability to obtain timely delivery of raw materials, equipment and other supplies, and in turn, adversely impact our ability to supply products to our customers. Such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented employee safety measures across all our supply chain facilities, including proper hygiene, social distancing and temporary screening which at a minimum are in compliance with local government regulations. These measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our employees. Illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism, or other workforce disruptions could negatively impact our supply chain, manufacturing, distribution or other business activities. ,\n",
       "   Additionally, the insolvency of, or contractual default by, any of our customers, suppliers and financial institutions, such as banks and insurance providers, may have a significant adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Such risks are exacerbated in times of economic volatility (such as economic volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic), either globally or in the geographies and industries in which our customers operate. If a counterparty defaults on a payment obligation to us, we may be unable to collect the amounts owed and some or all of these outstanding amounts may need to be written off. If a counterparty becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations in connection with a particular project, we may need to find a replacement to fulfill that party s obligations or, alternatively, fulfill those obligations ourself, which is likely to be more expensive. The occurrence of any of these risks, including any default by our counterparties, could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations, which effect may be material and result in a competitive disadvantage. ,\n",

In addition, our information systems increasingly rely on cloud solutions which require different security measures. These measures cover technical changes to our network security, organization and governance changes as well as alignment of third party vendors on market standards. As with all large systems, our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruption, information loss or shutdown due to power outages, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, hardware failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, catastrophic events, telecommunications failures, user errors, unauthorized access and malicious or accidental destruction or theft of information or functionality. ,\n",

Many of our products come into contact with the food and beverages they package and therefore we are also subject to certain local and international standards related to such products. Compliance with these laws and regulations can require significant expenditure of financial and employee resources. ,\n",
       "   In addition, changes to such laws, regulations and standards are made or proposed regularly, and some of the proposals, if adopted, might, directly or indirectly, result in a material reduction in the operating results of one or more of our operating units. For instance, an increase in legislation with respect to litter related to plastic packaging or related recycling programs may cause legislators in some countries and regions in which our products are sold to consider banning or limiting certain packaging formats or materials. Additionally, increased regulation of emissions linked to climate change, including greenhouse gas (carbon) emissions and other climate-related regulations, could potentially increase the cost of our operations due to increased costs of compliance (which may not be recoverable through adjustment of prices), increased cost of fossil fuel inputs and increased cost of energy intensive raw material inputs. However, any such changes are uncertain, and we cannot predict the amount of additional capital expenses or operating expenses that would be necessary for compliance. ,\n",
       "   Federal, state, provincial, foreign and local environmental requirements relating to air, soil and water quality, handling, discharge, storage and disposal of a variety of substances and climate change are also significant factors in our business and changes to such requirements generally result in an increase to our costs of operations. We may be found to have environmental liability for the costs of remediating soil or water that is, or was, contaminated by us or a third party at various facilities we own, used or operate (including facilities that may be acquired by us in the future). Legal proceedings may result in the imposition of fines or penalties, as well as mandated remediation programs, that require substantial, and in some instances, unplanned capital expenditure. ,\n",

Provisions are raised when it is considered probable that we have some liability. However, because the extent of potential environmental damage, and the extent of our liability for such damage, is usually difficult to assess and may only be ascertained over a long period of time, our actual liability in such cases may end up being substantially higher than the currently provisioned amount.

We review our goodwill balance for impairment at least once a year and whenever events or a change in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred using the business valuation methods allowed in accordance with current accounting standards. These methods include the use of a discount rate to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows of our reporting units. Future changes in the cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors may cause our goodwill and/or other intangible assets to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write down these assets for the amount of the impairment. In addition, if we make changes in our business strategy or if external conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, adversely affect our business operations we may be required to record an impairment charge for goodwill or intangibles, which would lead to decreased assets and reduced net operating results. If a significant write down is required, the charge would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net worth.

This assessment needs to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also generally requires an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

We identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting during the conversion of our historical AAS financial statements to U.S. GAAP. The first material weakness was related to our lack of accounting staff and supervisory personnel with the appropriate level of experience in technical accounting in U.S. GAAP and disclosure and filing requirements of a U.S. domestic registrant. We have fully remediated this material weakness as of the end of fiscal year 2020, see \"Item 9A, Controls and Procedures,\" for further information. ,\n",

       "  Amcor is a global leader in developing and producing responsible packaging for food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical, home and personal-care, and other products. Amcor works with leading companies around the world to protect their products and the people who rely on them, differentiate brands, and improve supply chains through a range of flexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons, closures, and services. The company is focused on making packaging that is increasingly light- weighted, recyclable and reusable, and made using an increasing amount of recycled content. During fiscal year 2020, approximately 47,000 Amcor employees generated $12.5 billion in sales from operations that spanned approximately 231 locations in over 40 countries. ,\n",
       "  Significant Items Affecting the Periods Presented ,\n",
       "  Impact of COVID-19 ,\n",
       "   The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") has introduced a period of unprecedented uncertainty and challenge. Amcor s operations have been largely recognized as 'essential' by governments and authorities around the world given the role we play in the supply chains for critical food and healthcare products. Our scale and global footprint has enabled us to collaborate with customers and suppliers to meet volatile changes in demand and continue to service our customers. In dealing with the exceptional challenges posed by COVID-19, we have established three guiding principles focusing on the health and safety of our employees, keeping our operations running and contributing to relief efforts in our communities. ,\n",
       "  Health and Safety ,\n",
       "   Our commitment to the health and safety of its employees remains our first priority. Our rigorous precautionary measures include the formation of global and regional response teams that maintain contact with authorities and experts to actively manage the situation, restrictions on company travel, quarantine protocols for employees who may have had exposure or have symptoms, frequent disinfecting of Amcor locations and other measures designed to help protect employees, customers and suppliers. We expect to continue these measures until the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for our business. ,\n",
       "  Operations and Supply Chain ,\n",
       "   To support our business partners, we have instituted business continuity plans in each of our operations and offices globally which address infection prevention measures, incident response, return to work protocols and supply chain risks. We have experienced minimal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing essential services. However, we have experienced volatility in customer order patterns in the second half of fiscal year 2020 and could continue to experience significant volatility in the demand for our products in the future. For instance, in April, our Rigid Packaging Segment sales volumes in North America and Latin America were adversely impacted as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and on-the-go channels. Our facilities have largely been exempt from government mandated closure orders and while governmental measures may be modified, we expect that our operations will remain operational given the essential products we supply. However, despite our best efforts to contain the impact in our facilities, it remains possible that significant disruptions could occur as a result of the pandemic, including temporary closures of our facilities. ,\n",
       "   We have not experienced any significant disruptions in our supply chain to date and continue to monitor the risk of customer, raw material and other supply chain disruptions. ,\n",
       "  Contributions to Our Communities ,\n",
       "   To support our local communities, we launched a global program to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 by donating food and healthcare packaging products and by funding local community initiatives to improve access to healthcare, education or food and other essential products. ,\n",
       "  Looking Ahead ,\n",
       "   We believe we are well-positioned to meet the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of this pandemic or its ultimate impact on the global economy and our operations and financial results. The ultimate near-term impact of the pandemic on our business will depend on the extent and nature of any future disruptions across the supply chain, the duration of social distancing measures and other government imposed restrictions and the nature and pace of macroeconomic recovery in key global economies. ,\n",

The restructuring and related expenses are comprised of approximately $90 million in employee related expenses, $25 million in fixed asset related expenses, $20 million in other restructuring and $30 million in restructuring related expenses. We estimate that approximately $150 million of the $200 million total integration costs will result in cash expenditures, of which $115 million relate to restructuring and related expenditures. Cash payments for the fiscal year 2020 were $80.2 million, of which $54.1 million were payments related to restructuring and related expenditures. The 2019 Bemis Integration Plan relates to the Flexibles segment and Corporate and is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2022. ,\n",

General integration costs are not linked to restructuring. We believe the disclosure of restructuring related costs provides more information on the total cost of our 2019 Bemis Integration Plan. The restructuring related costs relate primarily to the closure of facilities and include costs to replace graphics, train new employees on relocated equipment and anticipated loss on sale of closed facilities. ,\n",

       "   Our total 2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan pre-tax restructuring costs are expected to be approximately $110 million with the main component being the cost to exit manufacturing facilities and employee related costs. The total plan cost has been increased by approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 due primarily to additional non-cash impairments. We estimate that approximately $70 million of the $110 million total costs will result in cash expenditures. Cash payments for the fiscal year 2020 were $23.6 million. The 2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan is expected to be completed during fiscal year 2021. ,\n",
       "   On June 9, 2016, we announced a major initiative (\"2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan\") to optimize the cost base and drive earnings growth in the Flexibles segment. This initiative was designed to accelerate the pace of adapting the organization within developed markets through footprint optimization to better align capacity with demand, increase utilization and improve the cost base and streamlining the organization and reducing complexity, particularly in Europe, to enable greater customer focus and speed to market. ,\n",
       "   As part of the 2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan, we had closed eight manufacturing facilities and reduced headcount at certain facilities. Our total pre-tax restructuring costs were $230.8 million, with $166.7 million in employee termination costs, $31.4 million in fixed asset impairment costs and $32.7 million in other costs, which primarily represent the cost to dismantle equipment and terminate existing lease contracts. Approximately $166 million of the $230.8 million in total program costs resulted in cash expenditures. Cash payments for fiscal year 2019 were $14.4 million.

       "  access was temporarily restricted in March both in the U.S. and Europe due to the impact from COVID-19 on financial markets. We refinanced these maturities with drawings under our committed bank facilities. As a precautionary measure to maximize liquidity, in March 2020, we also extended our 364-day syndicated facility by an additional six months to October 2020 while reducing the facility size from $1,050.0 million to $840.0 million. This facility was canceled on June 29, 2020 following the issuance of a $500.0 million 10-year senior unsecured note on June 19, 2020 and a  500.0 million 7-year senior unsecured note on June 23, 2020. The Company also filed a Form S-3 shelf registration statement on June 10, 2020, which enabled the Company to issue the two notes in June 2020 and will enable the Company to issue debt securities in the future when market conditions are favorable and on a timely basis. ,\n",
       "  Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we might encounter difficulty in settling our debts or otherwise meeting our obligations related to financial liabilities. We manage our liquidity risk centrally and such management involves maintaining available funding and ensuring that we have access to an adequate amount of committed credit facilities. Due to the dynamic nature of our business, we aim to maintain flexibility within our funding structure through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans, corporate bonds, unsecured notes, commercial paper and factoring. The following guidelines are used to manage our liquidity risk: ,\n",
       "    maintaining minimum undrawn committed liquidity of at least $200 million that can be drawn at short notice;   regularly performing a comprehensive analysis of all cash inflows and outflows in relation to operational, investing and financing activities;   generally using tradable instruments only in highly liquid markets;   maintaining a senior credit investment grade rating with a reputable independent rating agency;   managing credit risk related to financial assets; ,\n",

       "   Amcor plc (\"Amcor\" or the \"Company\") is a holding company originally incorporated under the name Arctic Jersey Limited as a limited company incorporated under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey in July 2018, in order to effect the Company's combination with Bemis Company, Inc. On October 10, 2018, Arctic Jersey Limited was renamed \"Amcor plc\" and became a public limited company incorporated under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey. On June 11, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc (\"Bemis\"). The combination of Amcor and Bemis has created a global packaging leader. See Note 4, \"Acquisitions and Divestitures,\" for more information on the Bemis acquisition. ,\n",
       "   The Company develops and produces a broad range of packaging products including flexible packaging, rigid packaging containers, specialty cartons, and closures. The Company employs approximately 47,000 individuals and has 231 principal manufacturing facilities in more than 40 countries. ,\n",
       "   The Company's business activities are organized around two reporting segments, Flexibles and Rigid Packaging. The Company has a globally diverse operating footprint, selling to customers in Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa and the Asia Pacific regions. The Company's sales are widely diversified, with the majority of sales made to the defensive food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical device, home and personal care, and other consumer goods end markets. All markets are considered to be highly competitive as to price, innovation, quality and service. ,\n",

If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, or if market factors outside of Amcor s control, such as factors impacting the applicable discount rate, or economic or political conditions in key markets, change significantly, then goodwill allocated to one or more reporting units may be impaired. ,\n",
       "   The Company performs its annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each year. ,\n",
       "   A quantitative impairment analysis was performed in the fourth fiscal quarter for all reporting units for the fiscal years ended 2020 and 2018, while a qualitative analysis was performed for the fiscal year ended 2019. The Company s annual impairment analysis for all three fiscal years concluded that goodwill was not impaired. The Company s quantitative goodwill analysis in fiscal years 2020 and 2018 concluded that the fair values substantially exceeded the carrying amounts for each reporting unit. ,\n",
       "   Although no reporting units failed the assessments noted above in the annual impairment analysis for 2020, during the time subsequent to the annual evaluation, and at June 30, 2020, the Company considered whether any events and/or changes in circumstances, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, had resulted in the likelihood that the goodwill of any of its reporting units may have been impaired. It is management's opinion that no such events have occurred. ,\n",
       "  Other Intangible Assets, Net: Contractual or separable intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized against income using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, with original periods ranging from one to 20 years. The straight-line method of amortization reflects an appropriate allocation of the costs of the intangible assets to earnings in proportion to the amount of economic benefits obtained by the Company in each reporting period. The Company tests finite- lived intangible assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate carrying value may not be recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. ,\n",
       "   Costs incurred to develop software programs to be used solely to meet the Company's internal needs have been capitalized as computer software within other intangible assets. ,\n",
       "  Fair Value Measurements: The fair values of the Company's financial assets and financial liabilities reflect the amounts that would be received to sell the assets or paid to transfer the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company determines fair value based on a three-tiered fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy consists of: ,\n",
       "    Level 1: fair value measurements represent exchange-traded securities which are valued at quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the reporting date;   Level 2: fair value measurements are determined using input prices that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data; and   Level 3: fair value measurements are determined using unobservable inputs, such as internally developed pricing models for the asset or liability due to little or no market activity for the asset or liability. ,\n",
       "  Financial Instruments: The Company recognizes all derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The impact on earnings from recognizing the fair values of these instruments depends on their intended use, their hedge designation and their effectiveness in offsetting changes in the fair values of the exposures they are hedging. Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through income. Depending on the nature of derivatives designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in shareholders  equity through other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized. Gains or losses, if any, related to the ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized through earnings over the life of the hedging relationship. ,\n",
       "   See Note 11, \"Derivative Instruments,\" for more information regarding specific derivative instruments included on the Company s consolidated balance sheet, such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts, currency swap contracts, and interest rate swap arrangements, among other derivative instruments. ,\n",
       "  Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various defined contribution plans to which it makes contributions on behalf of employees. The expense under such plans was $63.5 million, $39.9 million and $39.8 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. ,\n",

       "  Form 10-K ],\n",
       " 75: [ The Company sponsors a number of defined benefit plans that provide benefits to current and former employees. For the company-sponsored plans, the relevant accounting guidance requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used to determine the present value of future obligations and expenses, salary inflation rates, mortality rates and other assumptions. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to its pension plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets, actuarial valuations, market conditions and contracted benefit changes. The selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation, as well as independent studies of trends performed by the Company s actuaries. However, actual results may differ substantially from the estimates that were based on the critical assumptions. ,\n",
       "   The Company recognizes the funded status of each defined benefit pension plan in the consolidated balance sheet. Each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset and each underfunded plan is recognized as a liability. Pension plan liabilities are revalued annually, or when an event occurs that requires remeasurement, based on updated assumptions and information about the individuals covered by the plan. Accumulated actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent corridor and the prior service cost are amortized on a straight-line basis from the date recognized over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average life expectancy for plans with significant inactive participants. The service costs related to defined benefits are included in operating income. The other components of net benefit cost other than service cost are recorded within other non-operating income (loss), net in the consolidated statement of income ,\n",
       "  Equity Method Investments: Investments in ordinary shares of companies, in which the Company believes it exercises significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the investment is carried at cost and is adjusted to recognize the investor s share of earnings or losses of the investee after the date of acquisition and is adjusted for impairment whenever it is determined that a decline in the fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary. The fair value of the investment then becomes the new cost basis of the investment and it is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value. Impairment losses have been recognized for the Company's equity investment in AMVIG Holdings Limited (\"AMVIG\") in the last three fiscal years. See Note 7, \"Equity Method Investments,\" for more information regarding the Company's equity method investments. ,\n",
       "  Share-based Compensation: Amcor has a variety of equity incentive plans. For employee awards with a service or market condition, compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis using the grant date fair value of the award and the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. For awards with a performance condition, the Company must reassess the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjust compensation cost based on its probability assessment. The Company also has cash-settled share-based compensation plans which are accounted for as liabilities. Such share-based awards are remeasured to fair value at each reporting period. The Company estimates forfeitures based on employee level, economic conditions, time remaining to vest and historical forfeiture experience. ,\n",
       "  Income Taxes: The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based upon enacted income tax laws and tax rates. Income tax expense or benefit is provided based on earnings reported in the consolidated financial statements. The provision for income tax expense or benefit differs from the amounts of income taxes currently payable because certain items of income and expense included in the consolidated financial statements are recognized in different time periods by taxing authorities. ,\n",
       "   Deferred tax assets, including operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards, are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that any portion of these tax attributes will not be realized. In addition, from time to time, management must assess the need to accrue or disclose uncertain tax positions for proposed adjustments from various tax authorities who regularly audit the Company in the normal course of business. In making these assessments, management must often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions. Accounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records the related interest expense and penalties, if any, as tax expense in the tax provision. See Note 16, \"Income Taxes,\" for more information on the Company's income taxes. ,\n",

The total 2019 Bemis Integration Plan costs include $165 million of restructuring and related expenses and $35 million of general integration expenses. The restructuring and related expenses are comprised of approximately $90 million in employee related expenses, $25 million in fixed asset related expenses, $20 million in other restructuring and $30 million in restructuring related expenses. The Company estimates that approximately $150 million of the $200 million total integration costs will result in cash expenditures, of which $115 million relate to restructuring and related expenditures. Cash payments for the fiscal year 2020 were $80.2 million, of which $54.1 million were payments related to restructuring and related expenditures.

       "  Rigid Packaging: Consists of operations that manufacture rigid plastic containers for a broad range of predominantly beverage and food products, including carbonated soft drinks, water, juices, sports drinks, milk-based beverages, spirits and beer, sauces, dressings, spreads and personal care items and plastic caps for a wide variety of applications. ,\n",
       "   Other consists of the Company's equity method investments, including AMVIG, undistributed corporate expenses, intercompany eliminations and other business activities. ,\n",
       "   Operating segments are organized along the Company's product lines and geographical areas. In conjunction with the acquisition of Bemis, the Company reassessed its segment reporting structure in the first fiscal quarter of 2020 and elected to disaggregate the Flexibles Americas operating segment into Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America. The five Flexibles operating segments (Flexibles Europe, Middle East and Africa; Flexibles North America, Flexibles Latin America; Flexibles Asia Pacific and Specialty Cartons) have been aggregated in the Flexibles reporting segment as they exhibit similarity in economic characteristics and future prospects, similarity in the products they offer, their production technologies, the customers they serve, the nature of their service delivery models, and their regulatory environments. ,\n",
       "   In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, in connection with the acquisition of Bemis, the Company changed its measure of segment performance from adjusted operating income to adjusted earnings before interest and tax (\"Adjusted EBIT\") from continuing operations. The Company's chief operating decision maker, the Global Management Team (\"GMT\"), evaluates performance and allocates resources based on Adjusted EBIT from continuing operations. The Company defines Adjusted EBIT as operating income adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the Company does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance and to include equity in income (loss) of affiliated companies. The GMT consists of the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer and his direct reports and provides strategic direction and management oversight of the day to day activities of the Company. ,\n",
       "   The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those in the consolidated financial statements and are discussed in Note 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies.\" The Company also has investments in operations in AMVIG that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, those results are not included in segment net sales. ,\n",

       " 130: [ Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020 given a previously identified material weakness had not been remediated as of fiscal 2020 year end. ,\n",
       "  The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers AG, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears on \"Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ,\n",
       "  Plan for Remediation of Material Weakness ,\n",
       "  We are currently in the process of remediating the material weakness related to deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over period end reporting through a process to (i) develop and implement additional controls and procedures to reduce the number of segregation of duties conflicts within key IT systems, which includes the implementation of new security roles and the automation of segregation of duties monitoring where practical, (ii) design and implement additional compensating controls where necessary and (iii) develop training on segregation of duties. Given we operate many ERP systems globally, this effort has targeted the largest locations with standardized systems in fiscal 2020 and will be expanded to other locations in fiscal 2021. These enhanced processes, including the implementation of new mitigating controls, will effectively remediate the material weakness, but the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the revised controls operate for a sufficient period of time and we have concluded, through testing, they are designed and operating effectively. We currently expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed by the end of fiscal 2021. However, there is no assurance that the material weakness will be fully remediated by the end of fiscal 2021 as the severity and length of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic is unknown and the remediation timeline could be negatively impacted because of inefficiencies caused by COVID-19 limitations on travel, meetings and on-site work. ,\n",
       "  Completed Remediation of Previously Reported Material Weakness ,\n",
       "  As previously described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we identified a material weakness related to a lack of experience in technical accounting in U.S. GAAP and U.S. domestic registrant filing requirements. Since the material weakness has been identified, we have taken numerous steps to address the underlying causes and to remediate the material weakness. We have hired additional financial reporting personnel with U.S. GAAP technical accounting and financial reporting experience, as well as U.S. domestic registrant filing experience, aligned our accounting policies and procedures with U.S. GAAP, enhanced our internal review procedures during the financial close process with U.S. GAAP experienced staff, and have conducted technical training for accounting and finance personnel. During our fourth fiscal quarter of 2020, we completed our testing of the operating effectiveness of the implemented steps and found them to be effective. As a result, we have concluded the material weakness has been remediated as of June 30, 2020. ,\n",
